Number Guesser Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Overview:
In this project, we'll create a number-guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game will provide feedback to the user, indicating whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct. We'll use HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity and logic.

Technologies Used:

HTML5: For structuring the webpage.
CSS3: For styling the user interface.
JavaScript: For handling game logic and interactivity.
Features to Implement:

Generate a random number within a specified range.
Allow the user to input their guess.
Provide feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
Keep track of the number of attempts.
Allow the user to restart the game.
Responsive Design: Ensure the game looks good and functions well across different devices and screen sizes.
Steps to Implement:

HTML Structure: Create the basic structure of the webpage using HTML. This includes elements for displaying the game interface, such as input fields, buttons, and messages.

Styling with CSS: Apply CSS to style the HTML elements, making the game visually appealing and easy to use.

Generate Random Number: Write JavaScript code to generate a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100).

User Input: Implement functionality to allow the user to input their guess through a text input field.

Check Guess: Write logic to compare the user's guess with the randomly generated number and provide feedback messages indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

Keep Track of Attempts: Increment a counter to keep track of the number of attempts the user has made.

Restart Game: Allow the user to restart the game once they have guessed the correct number or want to start over.

Styling Adjustments: Fine-tune the CSS styles to ensure the game's interface looks polished and user-friendly.

Responsive Design: Use media queries and other techniques to make the game responsive. Test the layout on various devices and adjust styles as needed.

Conclusion:
By following these steps, you'll be able to create a simple number-guessing game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project provides hands-on experience in building interactive web applications and practicing front-end development skills.
